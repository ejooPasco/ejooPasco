## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github account.

For a long time I did nearly nothing here, so I am basically new to github (08/2025) and now want to share a PHP/WordPress development library, which formed over years. 
As I want to use that library in another opensource project for my employer, so this is a very good time to get started with opensource and github.

Have fun with PX LIB. 

My name is Dirk Rathjens.
